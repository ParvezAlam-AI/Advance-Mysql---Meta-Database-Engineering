# Advance-Mysql---Meta-Database-Engineering
Advance Mysql course of Meta Database engineering. This is specific course  to learn and explore Mysql advance knowledge.

Module 1
In the first module, you'll receive an introduction to functions and triggers. The module begins with an overview of advanced database engineering topics, along with advice around how to succeed in this course.
You'll then move on to explore advanced MySQL functions and stored procedures. You'll learn how to work with variables and parameters, develop user defined functions, and create complex stored procedures. You'll also receive an opportunity to demonstrate these new skills in a lab environment.
The focus of the third lesson is on MySQL triggers and events. You'll begin the lesson with an overview of MySQL triggers and the different types of triggers that you can use in your databases. You'll then learn how to create and drop triggers MySQL and work with MySQL Scheduled Events.

By the end of this module you'll be able to:
Develop user-defined functions in MySQL
Develop complex SQL code in stored procedures
Create and drop triggers in MySQL
And create events to automate repetitive database tasks


Module 2
The second module in this course focuses on database optimization. The first lesson revolves around techniques for optimizing database queries. You'll receive an overview of database optimization, then review the best practices for optimizing database SELECT statements. You'll also learn how to work with indexes in MySQL

The second lesson continues the theme of optimization by exploring further optimization techniques. You'll learn how to make use of MySQL transaction statements, common table expressions and prepared statements. You'll also learn how to incorporate JSON syntax into your MySQL queries.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
Describe common approaches to database optimization
Optimize change statements in MySQL
Use the CREATE INDEX statement to add an index to a table
Use the COMMIT and ROLLBACK statements to manage transactions in MySQL
Use MySQL common table expressions to construct complex queries in a more readable manner
Use the MySQL prepared statement to make queries execute faster and more securely
And use the MySQL JSON data type to store JSON documents in the database.


Module 3
In the third module, you'll learn how MySQL informs data analytics. The first lesson in this module focuses on how to evaluate MySQL for data analytics. You'll begin with an overview of database analytics, then learn how you can use MySQL for data analysis, along with how MySQL is used with advanced data analytics tools.

The second lesson explores techniques and methods for performing data analysis in MySQL. For example, you'll learn how to perform data analysis in MySQL with the use of SQL queries by emulating the Full Outer JOIN and extracting data from multiple tables.

By the end of this module you'll be able to:
Describe common approaches to data analysis
Explore the benefits and limitations of using MySQL for data analysis
Explain the role of JOINS, subqueries and views in data analytics and reporting in MySQL
And query data from multiple tables in the database to gain useful information

Module 4
In the last module, you'll have an opportunity to recap what you learned, identify your strengths and target topics that you would like to revisit in this course. You'll also test your new skills in a lab environment and demonstrate your knowledge by undertaking a graded assessment.

By the end of this module you'll be able to:
Synthesize the skills you learned in this course to create a stored procedure for an example project
And reflect on the next steps in your learning journey.
